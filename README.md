# EcopackAI-AI-powere-sustinable-packing-recommendation-system

📌 Project Overview
EcoPackAI is an intelligent decision-support system designed to recommend eco-friendly and cost-efficient packaging materials for industries and e-commerce businesses.
The system evaluates packaging materials based on strength, sustainability, environmental impact, cost, and reuse potential, helping organizations reduce environmental damage without compromising product safety.

🎯 Problem Statement
Traditional packaging solutions rely heavily on non-biodegradable materials, leading to:
-Increased environmental pollution
-Higher carbon emissions
-Rising packaging costs
-Lack of data-driven material selection
-Businesses lack a smart system to compare sustainable alternatives while balancing durability, cost, and environmental responsibility.

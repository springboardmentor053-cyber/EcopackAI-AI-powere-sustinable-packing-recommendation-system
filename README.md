📦 EcoPackAI – Sustainable Packaging Analysis

📌 Project Overview

EcoPackAI is an AI-driven project focused on analyzing and recommending sustainable packaging materials based on environmental impact, performance, and cost-related factors.

This repository covers Module 1 (Data Collection & Management) and Module 2 (Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering).

📂 Module 1: Data Collection & Management

Objective:
To collect, structure, and store packaging material and product data.

Key Activities:

1.Created material and product datasets (material.csv, product.csv)

2.Defined meaningful attributes related to sustainability and performance

3.Imported datasets into PostgreSQL and validated schema

4.Ensured data consistency and completeness

Output:

Structured and validated raw datasets ready for preprocessing


🧪 Module 2: Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Objective:
To clean the dataset and generate new features for sustainability analysis.

Key Activities:

1.Checked and handled missing values

2.Removed duplicate records

3.Validated value ranges

4.Engineered sustainability-focused features using Python:

    i.CO₂ Impact Index

    ii.Performance Index

    iii.Material Suitability Score

Tools Used:

    1.Python

    2.Pandas

    3.Jupyter Notebook (VS Code)

Output:

module2_feature_engineered_materials.csv
